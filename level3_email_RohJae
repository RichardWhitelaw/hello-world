Richard, 
I apologize for the delay in response. We completely understand the value of the ViaSat-specified
Site Name. I will forward this specific request to the API development team to see if we can get
this done as an enhancement. I agree, any changes made through the portal (or offline by the account
team or support team) will be reflected in the API as well. 
 
Can you say more about what "additional information" you would like to add in addition to Site Name?
As the name implies, it is intended to describe the location rather than the service itself. Perhaps
you are actually looking to add more information about the service (that might be different for each
service at one location?). 
 
Also, here is alternative which may be slightly faster for us to implement: What if we were to add
that to the returned result in the ServiceInventory API instead? 
This is a call that returns service information for all active services:
//api.level3.com/OA/v1/Ticketing/serviceImage?customerNumber=1-ABCDEF 
Right now, this returns an array of all services, which you could then cache somewhere for lookup
and correlation when a ticket is opened on a particular service. We may be also able to add a filter
parameter to allow searching for a particular serviceID, product, or location instead, so you
wouldn't have to persist anything on your side. Instead, you could simply make the request for the
additional service info as needed (without having to sort through the entire list). 
 
Here is the current information that is returned. 
 
Name               Data Type      Description 
----               ---------      -----------
serviceIdentifier  String      CenturyLink-assigned Service Instance ID (SID) 
bandwidth          String      An indicator of the capacity and/or speed of a circuit. Example: DS3, which equates to a speed of 45 Mbps. 
product            String      The type of service that has been purchased. 
serviceType        String      One of the four major types of services or products provided by Level 3: Transport, IP, CDN and Voice services. 
serviceLocation    String      The physical address where your services are located. 
customerNumber     String      Also known as a Customer ID, Account ID or BUS-ORG ID. 
billingAccount     String      The Billing Account number assigned to the service. 
productIdentifier  String      The CenturyLink Product Identifier (PIID). 
alternateId        String      If it exists, this was the customer's Legacy Customer Number or Legacy Account ID. 
accountName        String      Customer name as displayed in the MyLevel3 portal. 
serviceComponentId String      Service Component ID or SCID

Gentlemen; 
 
Is it practicable for you to add the information in the “Site Name” column of the Level3 Portal to the information accessible via the REST API? 
 
The way your Portal is currently being used by Viasat is: 
                An order for a new circuit is opened. 
                In response to that order, Level3 creates a new record in the Service Inventory table of the Portal. 
                                In that record, the Site Name field is assigned a placeholder like ‘VIASAT’ or some such. 
                Viasat’s Dustin Tang logs into the  Portal and changes the value of the Site Name field to something appropriate to the actual site. 
 
What we would like to have (which doesn’t seem to be too ambitious) is a configuration supporting the following scenario: 
                A Viasat person modifies the placeholder Site Name to its permanent value—possibly including additional information on elements of 
                                the total circuit beyond what’s provided by Level3. 
                The information in that modified Site Name field is automatically retrieved by ViaSat’s interface to Level3’s REST API and provided 
                                to ViaSat’s NOC and any other interested parties. 
 
                One possible problem with this scenario other than the current inaccessibility of the Site Name to the REST API is that the Site Name 
                                field width is not big enough to accommodate the “additional information” mentioned above. 
                                Is it reasonable to assume that you at Level3 could do one or both of: 
                                  1.  Expand the size of the Site Name field 
                                  2.  Add an additional field that would be accessible both to the Portal and the REST API 
                                                ? 
                                Note that I am assuming here that manual modifications by Viasat personnel (Dustin Tang) to the Portal contents will 
                                                be visible via the REST API.

Adding Jae who might have some insight on these questions. I know our API roadmap for 2018 is not yet solidified.
